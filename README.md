## Hey there, I'm Ruaridh! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Student Developer from Scotland and I make a handful of things on GitHub. I mostly make things like small scripts and files to make software work the way I want it to.

Currently, I'm mostly making stuff for [Mue](https://github.com/mue) and [Discord Tickets](https://github.com/discord-tickets) but I have a few pinned projects I also work on below this README.
