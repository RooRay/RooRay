## Hi, Iâ€™m RooRay!

I'm a Student Developer from Scotland, UK and I make a handful of things on GitHub. I primarily try to make existing things better but that can have varying results. <sup>just wanna manage your expectations</sup>

Some cool stats about me are below if you wanna have a look at them: :^)
